This function block enables the group. If it is successful and all axes are ready, the group is then in the GroupStandby state (see State diagrams).

| 52645056 | An **MC group** can only be enabled once all axes have been added to the group. |

## 36391162 59085005 VAR\_IN\_OUT

```
VAR_IN_OUT  
    AxesGroup  : AXES_GROUP_REF;   
END_VAR
```

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |

## 62003000 VAR\_OUTPUT

```
VAR_OUTPUT  
    Done                  : BOOL;  
    Busy                  : BOOL;  
    Error                 : BOOL;  
    ErrorId               : UDINT;  
END_VAR
```

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Done | BOOL | This output becomes TRUE when the command was successfully executed. |
| Busy | BOOL | This output becomes TRUE when the command is started with Execute and remains so as long as the function block executes the command. If Busy becomes FALSE again, the function block is ready for a new command. At the same time one of the outputs Done, CommandAborted (if available) or Error is set. |
| Error | BOOL | This output becomes TRUE if an error has occurred during command execution. |
| ErrorId | UDINT | Contains the command-specific error code of the last executed command. Details of the error code can be found in the [ADS error documentation](ms-xhelp:///?Id=beckhoff-07bc-42ba-bf39-8bb430e44b38) or in the [NC error documentation](ms-xhelp:///?Id=beckhoff-7f1e-487d-a5ed-713a7234d65b) (error codes 0x4nnn and 0x8nnn). |
