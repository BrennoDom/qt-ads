This function block removes all axes and disables the group. If the function block is successful, the group is then in the GroupDisabled state (see State diagrams).

## 24512769 VAR\_INPUT

```
VAR_INPUT  
    Execute  : BOOL;  
END_VAR
```

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Execute | BOOL | The command is triggered by a rising edge at this input. |

## 19288335 39377290 VAR\_IN\_OUT

```
VAR_IN_OUT  
   AxesGroup             : AXES_GROUP_REF;   
END_VAR
```

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AxesGroup | AXES\_GROUP\_REF | Reference to a group of axes (see [Cyclic group interface](ms-xhelp:///?Id=beckhoff-64fb-4654-848c-3c33fe50f412)). |

## 18851291 VAR\_OUTPUT

```
VAR_OUTPUT  
    Done                  : BOOL;  
    Busy                  : BOOL;  
    Error                 : BOOL;  
    ErrorId               : UDINT;  
END_VAR
```

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Done | BOOL | This output becomes TRUE when the command was successfully executed. |
| Busy | BOOL | This output becomes TRUE when the command is started with Execute and remains so as long as the function block executes the command. If Busy becomes FALSE again, the function block is ready for a new command. At the same time one of the outputs Done, CommandAborted (if available) or Error is set. |
| Error | BOOL | This output becomes TRUE if an error has occurred during command execution. |
| ErrorId | UDINT | Contains the command-specific error code of the last executed command. Details of the error code can be found in the [ADS error documentation](ms-xhelp:///?Id=beckhoff-07bc-42ba-bf39-8bb430e44b38) or in the [NC error documentation](ms-xhelp:///?Id=beckhoff-7f1e-487d-a5ed-713a7234d65b) (error codes 0x4nnn and 0x8nnn). |
